Our potential contributions

- partitioned hash tables perform better than concurrent hash tables for kmer counting
- as compared to jellyfish, hardware has changed (NUMA overhead)
- Benchmarking our code: microbenchmark compare to MICA
- using avx512 and related instructions makes things faster

TODO Reading/Research/Code

- Jellyfish v1 understand custom hash table used, and its properties
- Jellyfish v2 improvements vs v1
- get results out of jellyfish
- compare jellyfish hash tables in MICA vs. Bytell space
- Look for fasta c++ libraries
- 3bits/4bit/n-bit representation of kmer makes a difference to hash table insertion overheads (jellyfish uses bigger keys)
- Work on fixing STANDALONE: bqueues is supposed to be pluggable into this
