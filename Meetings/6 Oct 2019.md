TODO

- Read and get idea of what's happening in bqueues code
- ifdef in makefile for numa exclusion (see vikram's commits for what are the numa parts)
- check what is currently being done w.r.t. the controller spawning producer threads
- fix producer_count -1 bug (if required)
- try to get the code running locally first: 5 producers, 5 consumers.
- try on cloudlab (num prod, consumers?)
