- check parameter for TICKS (look backtracking())
- cpu freq max out (always, in cloudlab)
- in experiment, simulate some "processing" of packet after dequeue
- check how cycles per message is calculated in code
- check what batch_size does
- bqueue-code differences
    - reason to use own test code?
    - remove inline and it works (bqueue-code)
    - for n cores, there are n-1 fifo queues
    - only one producer, several consumers
