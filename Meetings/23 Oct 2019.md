Readings:

- Memory consistency models, Sequential consistency, Total Store Ordering, ARM weak consisitency, memory barriers
    - morgan claypool
        - "Synchronization. Coherence makes caches invisible. Consistency can make shared memory look like a single memory module"
    - [https://www.cs.utexas.edu/~bornholt/post/memory-models.html](https://www.cs.utexas.edu/~bornholt/post/memory-models.html)
    - 

- MCRingBuffer, Bqueue
    - Still trying to reason how deadlock occurs in MCRingBuffer, how Bqueue resolves that
    - Batching how that helps:
        - both producer and consumer detect a batch of available slots\
- Experiments
    - If Batch size is decreased, cycles per message increases
    - Some waiting happenning on batch_size / 128 and further, looking into this.
