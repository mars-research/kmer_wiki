- check if bqueue algorithm is correct, meet to see if any changes are needed.
- cpu freq max out
- check parameter for TICKS (look backtracking())
- Array based queue and lock-free linked-lists are different (think)
    - [https://enqueuezero.com/lock-free-queues.html#array-based](https://enqueuezero.com/lock-free-queues.html#array-based)
    - there can be MPMC in linked-list based queues (?), but very difficult in array-based queues
    - all array-based queues are currently SPSC
    -

- There consumer_count*producer_count number of queues.
- We are not multiple producer multiple consumer (think)
- What every systems programmer should know about concurrency
    - [https://assets.bitbashing.io/papers/concurrency-primer.pdf](https://assets.bitbashing.io/papers/concurrency-primer.pdf)
- in experiment, simulate some "processing" of packet after dequeue
- check how cycles per message is calculated in code

- Comments after reading MCSRingBuffer and BQueue
    - backtracking is useful for deadlock ⇒ solves MCSRingBuffer's disadvantage (which actually causes deadlocks) ⇒ if producer is less than BATCH_SIZE ahead of consumer, consumer will block. (see if bqueue solves this)
    - bqueue still has null problem, as it uses buffer elements for condition (if buffer[], then do something), MCSRingBuffer does not do this. It specifically guards against this. '
    - -1 question
    - in bqueue, buffer should be a multiple of BATCH_SIZE.
