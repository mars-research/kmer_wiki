- debug inline?
- disable hyperthreading?
- use prefetch, and compare without prefetch.
- use quadratic probing instead of linear probing, and then compare with linear probing (have an option)
- use 100 million size of hash table and then measure time
- cityhash64 how many cycles it takesÂ (edited)

- conform to std so you can plug into this
- increase kmer count to 1 mil per core, time can increase due to l3 contention
- look into prefetch, have a minimal queue
- hyperthreading: /proj/redshift-PG0/tarfiles/startup/ht.sh
- pstate governor /etc/default/grub
